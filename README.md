Right now, this project is a Deemix-GUI plugin for Lidarr.

My intent is to convert it to speak with Deezer directly. My thought is, Deemix-GUI seems to merely be acting as a translation layer for API requests, and a simple downloader. As such, a plugin could theoretically do the same.

I don't truly know what I'm doing, so if you do, feel free to get it done first.
